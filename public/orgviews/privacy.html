        <br>We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, process a transaction, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, or credit card information. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Non-personal identification information</strong>
        <br>
        <br>We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site.

        <br>
        <strong>Web browser cookies<br></strong>
        <br>Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about their interaction with the Site. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
        <br>
        <br>When you register on our website, we might store some information on your computer in the form of a "cookie" (i.e. a small piece of text that stores information on your browser in your computer’s hard drive) or similar file. We do this to collect information about your activities on the website, make it possible for you to keep track of items you wish to purchase on our website, deliver to you content that is specific to your interests, and/or to prevent you from re-entering all your registration data at each connection. We also use conversion tracking cookies as part of our ad campaigns in order to analyze trends, gather broad demographic information, and monitor site traffic patterns that can help us further develop and improve the design and functionality of our site. Similarly, we also use cookies for “retargeting” in our internet advertising campaigns. Retargeting is a tactic that identifies previous visitors to a website and targets them for specific outreach by showing them an advertisement encouraging them to revisit that website. The cookies shall only be used to obtain non-personal information to improve your online experience. No other information is stored in these cookies. You can always set your browser to warn of cookies being placed, and then choose which cookies you want to accept.
